HiresW v8.0.0 - released September 14, 2020


Google docs version at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K61gTsztJGA7nVDb9bbDidMN3LTpiNcDzUNqs3KXL_A/edit?usp=sharing


#####################
Update overview 
#####################


* Removes the HiresW-NMMB, and adds a new HiresW-FV3


* The HiresW-FV3 increases the resolution of the HiresW-NMMB it replaces (from 3.2 km to 3.0 km horizontally, and from 50 to 60 vertical levels), and extends the forecast range from 48 h to 60 h.


* Switches CONUS SBN output to use a single full-CONUS grid for both ARW and FV3 (replacing legacy CONUS-east and CONUS-west SBN grids).


#####################
Obtaining and building the package
#####################


Clone it with this command (but change hiresw.v8.0.0 to whatever you want to call it in the directory that it is cloned into):


git clone -b v8.0_beta https://github.com/MatthewPyle-NOAA/regional_workflow.git hiresw.v8.0.0


Installation directions:


1. Check out the external components (UFS_utils, FV3 model, post processor)  for FV3:
cd sorc
./manage_externals/checkout_externals
2. Build the ARW executables:
cd arw
./link_fix.sh
The link_fix.sh step also pulls in prebuilt libraries needed for the build, so must be executed before build_hiresw.sh.   The BUILD_* variables near the top of the build_hiresw.sh script allow for selecting which codes to build.  Execute the script to build the requested executables.
./build_hiresw.sh
3. Install the ARW executables:
The install_hiresw.sh script has INSTALL_* variables corresponding to the BUILD_* variables in build_hiresw.sh in case there is a desire to only copy select executables to the final executable space.  Executing the script copies the executables to the proper exec/arw/ space.
./install_hiresw.sh
4. Build the FV3 executables:
cd ../fv3
./link_fix.sh
The link_fix.sh step also pulls in prebuilt libraries needed for the build, so must be run before build_all.sh
Control over what gets built by the build_all.sh script is contained in the regional_build.cfg file.  The delivered version should build all that is needed.
./build_all.sh
5. Install the FV3 executables:
Copies executables from the source directories to their final executable names under exec/fv3/
./install_all.sh

Product changes 
#####################




GRIB output changes:


In all comparisons here, CC is the cycle time, and FF is the forecast hour.  The right side of the --> indicates the file name in the new system.






1. For the main 5 km output grids:


hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_5km.fFF.DOM.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_5km.fFF.DOM.grib2


Where DOM is domain  (conus | guam | hi | pr | guam)


The new FV3 files have these products not in NMMB:


WEASD:surface:FF hour fcst: (instantaneous WEASD)
APCP:surface:0-FF hour acc fcst:(running total APCP)


FV3 also has consistent average heat flux computed over the previous hour - the NMMB averages fluxes with a 3 h bucket, so the period covered is variable (f01 would average f00-f01, f02 would average f00-f02, f03 would average f00-f03, f04 would average f03-f04)


2. For the 2p5km and 3km NDFD grids:


hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_2p5km.fFF.DOM.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_2p5km.fFF.DOM.grib2      
Where DOM is domain  (conus | guam | hi | pr)


+
hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_3km.fFF.ak.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_3km.fFF.ak.grib2      




The new FV3 files have these products not in NMMB:


WEASD:surface:FF hour fcst: (instantaneous WEASD)
APCP:surface:0-FF hour acc fcst:(running total APCP)






3. The CONUS output for AWIPS/SBN distribution is changed from east CONUS and west CONUS grids into a single CONUS grid.


hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_5km.fFF.conus{east|west}.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_5km.fFF.conussbn.grib2


The new FV3 files have these products not in NMMB:


WEASD:surface:FF hour fcst: (instantaneous WEASD)
APCP:surface:0-FF hour acc fcst:(running total APCP)


FV3 also has consistent average heat flux computed over the previous hour - the NMMB averages fluxes with a 3 h bucket, so the period covered is varaible (f01 would average f00-f01, f02 would average f00-f02, f03 would average f00-f03, f04 would average f03-f04)


The same change to a single output grid for CONUS SBN also  is made for the CONUS ARW output:


hiresw.tCCz.arw_5km.fFF.conus{east|west}.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.arw_5km.fFF.conussbn.grib2




4. The CONUS and Alaska “subset” grids have the following changes:


hiresw.t??z.nmmb_3km.fFF.conus.subset.grib2 --> hiresw.t??z.fv3_3km.fFF.conus.subset.grib2


hiresw.t??z.nmmb_5km.fFF.ak.subset.grib2 --> hiresw.t??z.fv3_5km.fFF.ak.subset.grib2


The FV3 files have these products not in NMMB:


WEASD:surface:FF hour fcst: (instantaneous WEASD)
APCP:surface:0-FF hour acc fcst:(running total APCP)






5. The 00 h output in both the ARW and FV3 model output has been cleaned up by eliminating hourly maximum and minimum fields, average fields, and accumulation fields, all of which lack meaning at the 00 h forecast time.


1. For the 00 h main 5 km output grids:


hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_5km.f00.DOM.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_5km.f00.DOM.grib2
+
hiresw.tCCz.arw_5km.f00.DOM.grib


Where DOM is domain  (conus | guam | hi | pr | guam), these records are removed:

SHTFL:surface:0-0 day ave fcst:
LHTFL:surface:0-0 day ave fcst:




2. For the 2p5km and 3km NDFD grid output:


hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_2p5km.f00.DOM.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_2p5km.f00.DOM.grib2      
hiresw.tCCz.nmmb_3km.f00.ak.grib2 --> hiresw.tCCz.fv3_3km.f00.ak.grib2      
+
hiresw.tCCz.arw_2p5km.f00.DOM.grib2
hiresw.tCCz.arw_3km.f00.ak.grib2


Where DOM is domain  (conus/guam/hi/pr), these records are removed:


MAXUVV:100-1000 mb::
MAXREF:1000 m above ground::
MXUPHL:5000-2000 m above ground::

3. For the 00 h “subset” product grids for CONUS and Alaska:


hiresw.t??z.nmmb_3km.f00.conus.subset.grib2 --> hiresw.t??z.fv3_3km.f00.conus.subset.grib2


hiresw.t??z.nmmb_5km.f00.ak.subset.grib2 --> hiresw.t??z.fv3_5km.f00.ak.subset.grib2

BUFR output changes:


In comparisons here, CC is the cycle time:


File names are modified:


hiresw.tCCz.conusnmmb.class1.bufr --> hiresw.tCCz.conusfv3.class1.bufr
hiresw.tCCz.conusnmmb.class1.bufr.wcoss --> hiresw.tCCz.conusfv3.class1.bufr.wcoss

#############################
Job/script changes of note:
#############################


Eliminates jobs used only by the HiresW-NMMB system that is being removed.


JHIRESW_NEMSINTERP_1
JHIRESW_NEMSINTERP_2
JHIRESW_NEMSINTERP_3
JHIRESW_NEMSINTERP_4


New FV3-only preprocessing jobs are added to generate the model initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions, respectively.  The JHIRESW_MAKE_BC job is designed to generate all boundary information simultaneously, so it is computationally intense but completes in about 4-7 minutes depending on domain.  


JHIRESW_MAKE_IC (4 nodes, 16 tasks total)
JHIRESW_MAKE_BC (20 nodes/80 tasks for HI/PR/Guam; 40 nodes/160 tasks for CONUS and AK)


The FV3 uses JHIRESW_POST_ODD and JHIRESW_POST_EVEN for all domains (the NMMB and ARW only use them for the CONUS domain) .  Snow depth changes for FV3 are computed by differencing the instantaneous snow depth at successive hours, so the odd/even jobs have a bit of overlap for the FV3 system.  The JHIRESW_POST_EVEN job (and scripts/fv3/exhiresw_post_even.sh.ecf) handles all of this differencing.  Both jobs need to be run to generate complete forecast output at a given hour. 


A new odd/even PRDGEN job is added (only used by the FV3 for the Alaska and CONUS domains):


JHIRESW_PRDGEN_EVEN
JHIRESW_PRDGEN_ODD


Resource usage for the POST and PRDGEN jobs are listed in the resource changes section below.


The rocoto/hiresw_*.xml files show how the parallel test system launched jobs and assigned resources.  Many of the resource definitions come from within rocoto/sites/wcoss_cray.ent

## Archiving to HPSS
####################


Some limited changes to how HIRESW data is archived are being proposed.  The first is to archive by cycle time rather than one single archive for the day.  The second critical item is to replace any “nmmb” references with “fv3” due to the model change within the HiresW.  Although the FV3 runs to 60 h, only the first 48 hours will be archived (just swapping nmmb with fv3 in what is currently saved)..


Comparing the size of just the NMMB aspects going to HPSS against the potential FV3 aspects, it looks like a very slight increase (~19.4 GB/day to ~20.0 GB/day) with this upgrade.  An HPCRAC request has been drafted but hasn’t been submitted as of this writing.


I have a prototype file with these desired changes, but did not include it in the code release.
